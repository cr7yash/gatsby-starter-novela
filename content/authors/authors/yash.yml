  An evergreen optimist, I am intrigued by the unknown and on a quest to know what is known. A software engineer by profession I have worked for companies where I have been able to gain experience about Artificial Intelligence and how the web works. Currently loving React.js and the apps that I can build through it. Follow me on my social profiles to be updated of what's new.
